                    <li>
                        Contrast - The colors seem randomly picked. 2 / 10.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repitition - The background image repeats itself multiple times. There is no coheasion. 3 / 10.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment - Nothing is aligned. 0 / 10.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity - Multiple things overlap. The page's space is barely used. 0 / 10.

                <p>
                    A fairly unique art blog, focusing primarly on "contemporary visual culture." Finding the beauty of in garbage essentially.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast - The color schemes flow together smoothly. There are no jarring colors. The colors are a little bland, but this allows the art to stick out as the main focus. 7/10.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is a comforting repitition in the page's layout, but not so overly used that it is 
                        nauseating. 8 / 10.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment - Everything is aligned perfectly. 10/10
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity - There is enough space so that things do not feel claustrophobic, while mainting a nice level of content on the page so that it does not feel barren. 9/10.
                    </li>
                </ul>
