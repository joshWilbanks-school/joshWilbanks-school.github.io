                                    This website is being made as a buisness page for my client, Kade.
                                    Kade is a hairstylest who wants a website to show off her work, tell people about herself, and to use for marketing.
                                    This website will also contain information about where she is currently working at,
                                    what services she is currently offering, how to contact her, as well as links to her other social media.

                    <h3><strong>Dynamic Functionality</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        On the contact page there will be a map showing her current salon and a form to allow for users to contact Kade, most likely using google forms.
                        Hopefully it will be similar in affect to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-contact-page-with-a-map-using-html-and-css/">this.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, there <em>MIGHT</em> be functionality for users to leave reviews. Linking in with google forms would be a good way to do this.
                        Because google forms is free and has an API, automatically updating user reviews could be done without the need for a backend.
                    </p>
